About me
======

I am a chief data scientist and also a researcher in the field of artificial intelligence. My journey begins with an atypical background in science. I have a PhD in astrophysics in which I studied the atmosphere of Venus in the case of an exoplanet in order to help characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets. Why AI in this case? I used data processing and data mining methods during my PhD which allowed me to become a data scientist and to learn machine and deep learning methods.
I'm passionately curious and I want always to deep dive the different methods and how they work.

Research axis
======

My main areas of research are:
- NLP with Representation Learning to extract informations and knowledges
- Causality and uncertainty propagation
- Astrophysics: 
    - Detection of exoplanets and caracterization of their atmosphere.  
    - Stellar Spots and their impact on lightcurves
    - Stellar activity and the impact on the exoplanet parameters

I'm working with the University of Laval and the University of Chicoutimi through a partnership on three major axes:
- Data mining and data generation
- Ethics, Bias, Fairness, Explainability
- Cybersecurity using AI

Interests
======

I have also many interests in different fields like Reasoning, Reinforcement Learning, Graph theory, GNN, Knowledge Graph
