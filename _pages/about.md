About me
======

I am a chief data scientist and also a researcher in the field of artificial intelligence. My journey begins with an atypical background in science. I have a PhD in astrophysics in which I studied the atmosphere of Venus in the case of an exoplanet in order to help characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets. Why IA in this case? I used data processing and data mining methods during my PhD which allowed me to become a data scientist and to learn machine and deep learning methods.
I'm passionately curious and I want always to deep dive the different methods and how they work.
