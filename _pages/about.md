======

I am a senior data scientist and also a researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence. My journey begins with an atypical background in Science. I have a Ph.D. in astrophysics in which I studied the atmosphere of Venus in the case of an exoplanet to help characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets. Why AI in this case? I used data processing and data mining methods during my Ph.D., which allowed me to become a data scientist and learn the machine and deep learning methods.
I'm passionately curious, and I always want to deep dive into new methods to see how they work.  
I also have a disability. I have Asperger's Syndrome and high autism. My vision of the world is slightly different from the other. I can not detect or understand the emotional behaviour nor see the embarrassment when talking to someone. Social interactions are a mess for me because I must learn how to react during conversations.

Research axis
======

My main areas of research are:
- Deep Learning
- Causality and uncertainty propagation
- Quantum Computing - started recently with a focus on QML
My future areas are in:
- Reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning with constraints environments
- Graph Neural Networks and Graph Representation Learning


I'm working with the University of Laval and the University of Chicoutimi through a partnership on three major axes:
- Data mining and data generation
- Ethics, Bias, Fairness, Explainability
- Cybersecurity using AI

Interests
======

I have also many interests in different fields like:
- Reasoning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Graph theory
- GNN
- Knowledge Graph
- Source separation
- Complex and Quaternion Neural Networks
- Hopfield Network
- Quantum Computing
- Neurosciences
