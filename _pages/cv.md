* <p style="color:#F87217">2013/09 - 2016/10: Ph.D Student</p>
  * <b>Lagrange and Meudon Laboratories</b>, Nice and Meudon, France
  * Subject: [Study of the atmosphere of Venus with a refraction model when passing across the Sun the June, 5-6 2012](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01477867)
  * Study of the atmosphere of Venus during the transit of 2012 thanks to the phenomenon of light refraction. The atmosphere deflects the light rays and creates a light arc called "aureole". This information was extracted from the images and then modeled to find the atmospheric composition and temperatures during this phenomenon. These results allowed the validation of the measurements made by the Venus Express probe in orbit at that time. The simulations were carried out in the python/C/C++ languages and also in parallel computing.
